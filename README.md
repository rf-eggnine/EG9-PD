# MIT_-1 License
[![License: MIT_-1](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT_-1-lightgrey.svg)](LICENSE)

A variant of the popular [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit/) that includes an explicit disclaimer for individuals whose employers or schools decline to provide formal copyright waivers.

## ✍️ Purpose

The MIT_-1 License was created to allow independent developers—especially those working under employment or academic agreements—to open source their personal work **while acknowledging potential third-party claims** from their institution.

This license is ideal for:

- Developers whose **employers or schools** have not granted a formal IP waiver
- Individuals who wish to share their code openly, but **do not want to mislead others** into thinking it's risk-free
- Projects that aim to be transparent about their IP status and legal context

## ⚖️ What's Different from MIT?

MIT_-1 retains all the freedoms of the original MIT license:

- ✅ Free use, modification, distribution, sublicensing, and sale
- ✅ Provided "as-is", with no warranty

But adds the following disclaimers:

- 📌 Clearly states the software is not endorsed by the author's current or former **employer(s)** or **school(s)**
- 📌 Notes that IP claims **may exist** and that users should **evaluate that risk**
- 📌 Specifies this is a **variant** of MIT, not endorsed by MIT (the school) or the Open Source Initiative

## 🛑 Use at Your Own Risk

While the software licensed under MIT_-1 is provided with generous permissions, the added disclaimer introduces uncertainty that **could affect legal risk** in commercial or sensitive environments.

You are encouraged to review the license in full and consult legal counsel if needed.
